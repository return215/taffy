# Taffy

Also in: [Indonesian](readme.id.md)

Taffy is a web novel/music album project originally intiaied by @HDX13-BeatCode
that features the story of a boy with musical talent, glowing hand, and
self-control issues. This project was hosted in 
[this repo](https://github.com/hdx13-beatcode/taffy)

The project is now under reconstruction by @return215,
where the stories and the soundtracks will be made from the ground-up while
retaining the concept made by the original author. 

For the story, it is currently written in two languages: English and Indonesia. 
The author was from Indonesia, so the Indonesian version was included. Please
note that the English version may be way ahead from the Indonesian,
so translators are welcome to contribute.

## Synopsis

TBD

## Naming

We will be using these files for examples: 
`00.md`, `00.id.md`, `01.md`, `11.md`, and `12.id.md`.

* The numbering system uses hexadecimal format. This means number 10 is 
  represented as `A`, 11 as `B`, 12 as `C`, until 15 as `F`. 0 is `0` here 
  and will represent the prologue for the respective story/act.
* The first digit represents the act number. This means `00.md`, 
  `00.id.md`, and `01.md` is in the prologue act. `11.md` and 
  `12.id.md` belongs to the first act.
* The second digit represents the chapter number. Chapter 0 is a prologue 
  chapter for the act, and is completely optional to read. 
  Sometimes, an act doesn't have a prologue (`*0.md`). It doesn't matter much.
* The additional two-letter code is the language for the file. `*.id.md` means
  it's in Indonesian. No additional codes means the file is written in English.
* The story is written in Markdown, an easy writing syntax that is easy to read
  both as a text file or rendered in the web browser.
